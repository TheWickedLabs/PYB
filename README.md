Take It In The Boot: You've got root but do you even put it in your boot? A module to systemlessly modify your boot graphic.

When you install this module you can rest comfortably knowing that your friends and loved ones will see that you are a sophisticated person who simply won't settle for anything but the best. Whether the graphics are large or small, you'll stick them in your boot with relative ease. You'll be the talk of all of your friends; they'll ask "OMG how did they get all of that in their boot". Perhaps at your next company Christmas party your boss will have a little too much eggnog and he'll quietly stumble over and corner you. Through clenched teeth and with a menacing glare, he'll demand you show him how you easily you take it in the boot; we see a pay increase in your future. Don't worry we won't tell anyone how you love to put it in your boot, its our little secret.

Every module for changing boot graphics thatI could find did absolutely nothing when installed with the exception of liveboot which replaces the system boot animation loader. I'm honestly not sure if that is a Pixel issue or an Android issue however, I don't have any other phones to test on.

If modules to customize your boot graphics have had no effect, perhaps this will solve your problems.

Put It In Your Boot: You've got root but do you even put it in your boot? A Kernelsu Next/Magisk/Kwrnelsu/etc module to systemlessly modify your boot graphic. No thinking or prep work required*, simply flash and reboot.

When you install this module you can rest comfortably knowing that your friends and loved ones will see that you are a sophisticated person who simply won't settle for anything but the best. Whether the graphics are large or small, you'll put them in your boot with relative ease. You'll be the talk of all of your friends; they'll ask "OMG how did they put all of that in their boot". Perhaps at your next company Christmas party your boss will have a little too much egg nog and he'll quietly stumble over and corner you. Through clenched teeth and with a menacing glare, he'll demand you show him how you easily put it in your boot; we see a pay increase in your future. Don't worry we won't tell anyone how you love to put it in your boot, its our little secret.
